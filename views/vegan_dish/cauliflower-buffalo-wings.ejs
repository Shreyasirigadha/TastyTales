        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, almond milk, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper to create a smooth batter.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, place the breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Dip each cauliflower floret into the batter, ensuring it's well-coated, then roll it in the breadcrumbs, pressing gently to adhere.</li>
            <li>Place the coated cauliflower florets on the prepared baking sheet, ensuring they are not touching. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown and crispy.</li>
            <li>While the cauliflower is baking, mix together the buffalo sauce and melted vegan butter in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Once the cauliflower is done baking, transfer it to a large bowl. Pour the buffalo sauce mixture over the cauliflower and toss until each piece is well-coated.</li>
            <li>Return the coated cauliflower to the baking sheet and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the sauce is sticky and the cauliflower is crispy.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes. Serve the Cauliflower Buffalo Wings with celery sticks and vegan ranch dressing.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your delicious Cauliflower Buffalo Wings!</li>
